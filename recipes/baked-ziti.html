        Description
    </h4>
    <p>
        Baked Ziti is a main pasta dish, and is a simple, yet
        delightful meal. It is a favorite of many, and can be
        a go-to recipe when trying to decide what to have for 
        a meal. The dish can also be made without the meat for
        those with that preference.

        Steps

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to
            a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente,

        <li>Meanwhile, mix brown ground beef and onion in a large
            skillet over medium heat, stir in spaghetti sauce
            and simmer for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to
            350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch
            baking dish.

        <li>Spread 1/2 of the ziti in the bottom of the prepared
            dish.
        </li>
        <li>Top with provolone cheese.</li>
        <li>Top with sour cream</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 of the meat sauce, remaining ziti,
            mozzarella cheese, and remaining meat sauce.

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through
            and cheeses have melted, about 30 minutes.
