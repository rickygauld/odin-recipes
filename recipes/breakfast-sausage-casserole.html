        Ingredients
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound pork sausage</li>
        <li>8 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees
            C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>Cook sausage in a large, deep skillet over
            medium-high heat, until evenly browned, 7 to
            9 minutes. Drain and crumble into small pieces.
        </li>
        <li>Mix beaten eggs, mozzarella, cheddar, and oregano
            together in a large bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Line the bottom of the prepared baking dish
            with crescent roll dough, then sprinkle crumbled
            sausage over top. Pour egg mixture over sausage.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted
            into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30
            minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
