# odin-recipes

Project: Recipes is the first project to complete given by TOP. The project is structured to practice all of the HTML knowledge that has been covered and acquired.

In Project: Recipes, I will build a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main page which will have links to a few recipes. The website will not look polished, as the focus of the project is using HTML and building the foundations of constructing a website using HTML. The project will be revisited in the future to style it up using CSS.

Self Reflection:

*This will be completed at the end of the project, reviewing what I have learned. I will discuss all of the objectives earlier in the README, but I will discuss what I have learned with each objective in this section.
