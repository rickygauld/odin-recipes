# odin-recipes

Project: Recipes is the first project to complete given by TOP. The project is structured to practice all of the HTML knowledge that has been covered and acquired.

In Project: Recipes, I will build a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main page which will have links to a few recipes. The website will not look polished, as the focus of the project is using HTML and building the foundations of constructing a website using HTML. The project will be revisited in the future to style it up using CSS.

Self Reflection:

I feel like I have an extremely solid foundation to creating
a basic HTML website. While most topics that were utilized are very familiar, it was great being able to practice the basics of an HTML website to serve as the foundation for more complex HTML topics to implement in the future.

Although there are commands to have the code editor write an HTML boilerplate for you, I am confident about the boilerplate set-up and could do so easily. I want to learn other possible elements that could be included that are quality-of-life inclusions, and I could implement into the my existing boilerplate from memory.

Out of all the elements and HTML topics that were utilized in the project, I feel confident about all of them. I easily understand headings, both ordered and unordered lists, and paragraphs. I did not use many nested, in-text elements for the project sush as the 'strong' and 'em' elements. I might go back and include a few in specific pages' recipe descriptions. I know this project will be used as the basic website for a CSS project, so I don't want to include an abundance of these elements.

I also feel extremely confident with command line git commands. I was able to easily add and commit files as I made changes, and after a few commit iterations I would push my main local files to the origin remote repository on GitHub. I would like to learn about certain git command line sub-commands, as I think it would be an extremely useful tool for organization.

For topics I would like to work on, I would carry over my statement from the previous section and organization. My code and commit history is organized, but I want to establish a constant and consistent structure to how I code. Whether it be nesting the element attributes on seperate lines, to how often to include HTML comments. It is difficult to decide as there are some organizational practices that can differ from each person, so I want to find the ones that not only stick well with me, but are also good for collaborators and those who view my projects.
